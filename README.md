With decades of experience in the production of high-quality supplements and chemical solutions, we are committed to delivering innovative and effective products for modern agriculture.
What is Phytase and Why Does It Matter?
Phytase is a crucial enzyme that enhances the digestion of phytic acid, a primary storage form of phosphorus found in plant-based feed ingredients like grains and oilseeds. Phytic acid is indigestible to many monogastric animals, such as poultry and pigs, which leads to inefficient nutrient utilization and environmental concerns due to undigested phosphorus excretion.
Adding phytase to animal feed allows livestock to liberate more usable phosphorus, resulting in better bone development, enhanced growth rates, and reduced dependency on inorganic phosphorus supplements. This enzymatic solution also helps to lower environmental pollution by decreasing phosphorus waste in manure, aligning with sustainable agricultural practices.
